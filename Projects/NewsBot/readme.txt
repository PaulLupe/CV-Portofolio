A great part of my job is that I have access to something called Daily Security Briefing: a collection of important news in the world of cybersecurity. AS part of my interest in the field, I also have a few newsletter subscriptions delivered to my email every week. So, as I got the latest [tl;dr sec] email, I thought it might be fun to build a bot that scans a list of cyber security news websites and emails me the titles, links and summaries, all in 1 email. Yes, kinda like a RSS service.
