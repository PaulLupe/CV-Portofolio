I am a young profesisonal with a profound interest in technology and a passion for cybersecurity looking to transition into the field. This is a collection of projects that are meant to supplement my CV as I'm trying to transition into a role in IT.

From an early stage I loved tinkering with technology and different electronics around the house and quickly aquired the title of the "coomputer guy" of the neighbourhood. This has developed over time and even more so in the last couple of years and my current role has me working closely with CIOs, CISOs and orther heads of IT departments and most of my close friends working in the field.
