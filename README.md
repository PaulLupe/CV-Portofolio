I am a young professional with a profound interest in technology and a passion for cybersecurity, looking to transition into the field. This is a collection of projects meant to supplement my CV as I work toward a role in IT.

From an early age, I loved tinkering with technology and electronics around the house and quickly acquired the title of the "computer guy" in the neighborhood. This interest has only grown over time, especially in the last couple of years. My current role involves working closely with CIOs, CISOs, and other heads of IT departments, and most of my close friends work in the field.
